##  The Challenge
Start navigating the world of Object-Oriented programming by learning C++, from mastering its syntax and standard library to applying OOP principles and memory management techniques efectively. While I am still facing some constrains from the 42 subjects.

Let's go!

## The Modules
### CPP_00
- Introducing fundamental concepts and syntax.
- Understanding classes
- ex00: string manipulation
- ex01: OOP aplication by simulating a Phonebook application.

### CPP_01
- ex00 to ex02: These exercises introduce you to dynamic memory allocation, constructors, destructors, and the basics of OOP in C++.
- ex03: It's about the use of references, pointers and class relationships and in which scenarios use each one.
- ex04: It's about reproducing the behavior of the replace function of the string library and handling all the edge cases.
- ex05: Here I am learning about the use of pointers to member functions and an understanding of managing different levels of verbosity or logging.

### CPP_02
 This module is about learning the Orthodox Canonical Form by applyinh a fixed-point number.
 
 By giving some main function examples and certain instruction on each exercise you need you create you own Orthodox Canonical Form class named Fixed and make you program work to get the expected output.

 Sound fun, right?

 Take a look if you're interested in learning about this.

 ### CPP_03
 Module to Introduce Inheritance in C++. It focuses in the concepts of base classes, derived classes.
 - ex00 and ex01: Create a base class and a derived class to understand the basics of inheritance
 - ex02: Now it's time to extend the inheritance hierarchy by adding another derived class
 - ex03: Understand the concept of multiple inheritance and the diamond problem.

 ### CPP_04
This module introduce you to Polymorphism, and memory management.
- ex00: Bring inheritance knowledge from previous module and understand how polymorphism allows for dynamic method binding.
- ex01: This exercise extends the previous one by creating a class hierarchy with multiple levels and ensuring proper construction and destruction of objects. Example: By instantiate a Dog object with its own independent Brain object.
- ex02: Abstract classes are introduced here. They are used to be used as a base class, and you cannot instantiate directly from abstract classes.
- ex03: Interfaces do not exists in C++98 so in this exercise it's about trying to implement them. Interfaces = Pure abstract classes.
