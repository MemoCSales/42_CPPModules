##  The Challenge
Start navigating the world of Object-Oriented programming by learning C++, from mastering its syntax and standard library to applying OOP principles and memory management techniques efectively. While I am still facing some constrains from the 42 subjects.

Let's go!

## The Modules
### CPP_00
- Introducing fundamental concepts and syntax.
- Understanding classes
- ex00: string manipulation
- ex01: OOP aplication by simulating a Phonebook application.

### CPP_01
- ex00 to ex02: These exercises introduce you to dynamic memory allocation, constructors, destructors, and the basics of OOP in C++.
- ex03: It's about the use of references, pointers and class relationships and in which scenarios use each one.
-ex04: It's about reproducing the behavior of the replace function of the string library and handling all the edge cases.
-ex05: Here I am learning about the use of pointers to member functions and an understanding of managing different levels of verbosity or logging.
